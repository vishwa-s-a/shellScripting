* every bash code file should start with #! /bin/bash, as it includes the path of the bash's binary file so shell comes to know that it is .sh file
* to compile and run  a file we use the command bash fileName.sh
* 
* symbols used for output redirection:
i) > symbol to write to a file
ii) >> symbol to append to a file
* echo $?   command shows the status of the last operation
* in terminal if it is given [ hello = hello ]
  here instead of '=' we can also give '-eq'
  then the status of the operation will be 0
  if it is given [ hello = helo ]
  then the status of the operation will be 1
  we can check the status of the operation using echo $? command
